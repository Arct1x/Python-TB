# Python-TB


This is a Python Trigger Bot for Valorant but its an external so it can work with any shooter games that has a (perferabbly) enemy outline, you may need to edit the code (ITS OPEN SOURCE)

You need a few packages before you can start.

Run the following:
...> Pip install pyautogui
...> Pip install pynput
...> Pip install Pillow

Run the code either from source or using a source code ediotr such as VSC. Do not expect it to work :(
